# DevOverflow

This is the DevOverflow project I coded along with the Ultimate Next.js 15 course.

> You can check [the official source code here](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/jsmasterypro_devflow).

## What's the different between my code and JSMastery's code?

- Use Bun to manage packages.
- More helper scripts in [`package.json`](./package.json).
- More TypeScript more type (function return types, type as definition...)
